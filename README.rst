The Jubilant Pancake
--------------------
We would like to see a front end page that contains 2 input fields, which are
then sent to the backend service that computes the similarities between the two
strings and returns the input back the end user.

Constraints
-----------
You must meet the following constraints in order for the project to be
considered valid:

#. No page reload
#. JSON dependent on both ends
#. Use Python as the programming language


Scoring
-------
Your code will be judged based on the following scoring system:

  #. make it look nice ( we will judge how nice it is as part of the scoring
  system)
  #. test coverage
